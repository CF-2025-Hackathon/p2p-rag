# MariaDB health checks in WordPress
##### Project Description
MariaDB Server is one of the most popular open-source databases. It enjoys a rich ecosystem of storage engines, plugins, and many other tools. This makes it very versatile in a wide variety of use cases. The MariaDB Foundation exists to ensure that MariaDB Server stays open, help to increase its adoption, and work towards growing an ecosystem around it.
We at the MariaDB Foundation love WordPress and regularly test our releases against it. As such, we would love to make MariaDB Server easier to manage for our WordPress users.For this hackathon project, we would like you to create a WordPress Feature Project () that can give suggestions on how to improve the health of your MariaDB installation. It should also be able to provide current health-related metrics (graphs) based on the statistics stored within MariaDB.
The following features should be included in such a project:
  * Modular enough to allow similar checks with other database servers, but developing the support for these is outside of scope.
  * Check to see if histograms have been run on MariaDB Server, with the option to run them (). It should be possible to undo this too.
  * Check the current MariaDB Server version number to see if an update is available, with links to obtain the update.
  * Additionally, check to see if the version is reaching near end of life.
  * Collect data for, and display, health graphs based on MariaDB Server variables and information_schema data.
  * Ability to override the MariaDB update links for hosting providers.


##### Target Audience
Anyone with experience working inside WordPress or general developers who know a little bit of PHP. The project will also need people who know UI and UX. An understanding of MariaDB is not essential, as a MariaDB Foundation representative will be with you to help.
##### Hackathon Goals
The goal is to create a WordPress Feature Project that can provide health information and advice for the MariaDB installation underneath it.

# Wappspector: CLI utility to scan and identify the CMS/eCommerce/top frameworks used in a hosting server’s websites
##### Project Description
We propose the development of a command-line interface (CLI) utility to analyze the file structure of a web hosting server and identify the frameworks and CMS used in the websites hosted on it. This utility will function similarly to Wappalyzer, but with the following differences:
  * It will examine the app structure on the file system rather than making HTTP requests, allowing it to identify technologies used on non-resolved or staging websites.
  * It will have a focus on CMS and eCommerce applications, enabling it to identify the most popular apps with higher accuracy.
  * It will have an extendable mechanism that allows hosting providers to customize the utility to their needs, or provide simple instructions for adding new checks.


##### Target Audience
Would you like to know which CMS/technologies your customers use?Do you want to provide reliable instruments for them based on analytics data?Can you write code fast using PHP or Go languages?Feel free to join and help us!
##### Hackathon Goals
The goal of this hackathon project is to create an MVP of the CLI utility, which will scan the vhost’s folders and display results for the most popular CMS/eCommerce/framework technologies used in the websites it is hosting.

  * We also want to work with designers familiar with vector images to Design the Wapuus and items
  * Textual contributors


##### Hackathon Goals
Our goals with Wapuugotchi during the CloudFest Hackathon:
  * Brainstorm ideas on how to get users to engage with their instance in a fun way, building a stronger affinity for WordPress.
  * Provide an engaging way for WordPress users to receive important notifications over their personalized Wapuu.
  * Create a hook system that enables other plugins to add notifications, quests and (unlockable) items.
  * Improve user productivity and engagement within the WordPress platform.
  * Build items that can be used to customize the Wapuu.

38,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/enhanced-wordpress-unit-testing-suite/,0,Main Project Description,"Enhance WordPress unit testing suite for easy adaptation of web servers, databases, and PHP compatibility.","# WordPress Tools for Hosting Providers
##### Project Description
WordPress is the most used content management system in the world, and that implies, mainly, that hosting providers have to adapt to all its new features.
Knowing that the next versions of WordPress work correctly, maintaining compatibility with web servers, databases and, mainly, PHP, is a challenge for both the Core, as for the other extensions (plugins, themes, CLI …).
With the current PHPUnit Tests tools, we only get so far. But what is the limit?
##### Target Audience
Mainly PHP developers who are used to doing unit tests (PHP Unit Tests) and who want to extend and improve their testing tools.
##### Hackathon Goals
Improve the WordPress unit testing tools to not only analyze WordPress Core but include the ability to test more complex installations with common plugins or themes, and the WP-CLI tools.
Improve reporting so that information flows in a better way to both hosting companies and the corresponding WordPress teams (Test, Core, Hosting) and plugin and theme developers.

# docs_dangit:A search engine for WordPress developers
##### Project Description
Introducing “docs_dangit”, a search engine specifically designed for WordPress developers. With docs_dangit you can easily find the code examples you need from a variety of official documentation sources, all in one place. Simply enter a keyword or phrase, and docs_dangit will return a list of relevant code examples; be it PHP code or WP-CLI command. Plus, with advanced filtering options, you can narrow down your search results to find exactly what you’re looking for.
##### Target Audience
It’s not really mandatory for this to be built in PHP, but for the sake of future maintenance it is preferred language. JavaScript is welcomed as well. The main target audience is developers who would like to build this tool.
##### Hackathon Goals
The only problem with this search engine is that it doesn’t exist.Yet.Let’s build it together, starting with Code reference and WP-CLI handbooks, and make the world a little bit better. Name is open for voting (e.g. add_love, remove_pain etc).

# WordPress runtime vulnerability analysis
##### Project Description
The aim of this project is to build a tool that can dynamically probe a WordPress installation running within a container and detect probable security vulnerabilities.
The tool is inspired by the wpgarlic proof-of-concept article and basically tries to create bogus requests and find out where these requests end up producing unexpected output, rather than only performing a static analysis on the code.
It will first understand how the plugin behaves and what data it accesses, such as from the GET and POST parameters. Then, the tool will inject itself into the core and plugin’s functions to intercept and retrieve data, create actions, send requests, and stress the plugin in the hopes of detecting unescaped output or leaking internal data.
##### Target Audience
The main goal for the Hackathon is to create a powerful fuzzer with the following characteristics:
  * It doesn’t rely at all on entropy/randomness and provides fixed results throughout scans with better rules in order to lower the false positives;
  * It has a modular system to add new scans and rules easily;
  * It injects itself into methods and classes during runtime without editing the source code;
  * It tries to find and display the vulnerability source.


##### Hackathon Goals
Backend Developers, Security Researchers

41,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/cookie-analysis-tool/,0,Cookie Analysis Tool - Cloudfest 2023 Hackathon Project,"A tool to analyze and understand website usage of affected technologies, including 3PC, user agent strings, and user IP, in response to the Privacy Sandbox.","###### CLOUDFEST 2023 HACKATHON PROJECT
# Cookie Analysis Tool
##### Project Description
To respond effectively to changes driven by the Privacy Sandbox and make use of the opportunities offered by the new APIs and solutions website owners and maintainers need first to understand in detail how their sites are currently making use of affected technologies, which are 3rd-party cookies (3PC), user agent string and user IP.
Arguably, the broadest affected surface consists of 3PC, so the highest priority efforts currently need to be focused on the challenges associated with their deprecation.
Many modern sites make use of dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of cookies to support the most diverse set of functionalities: from advertising to traffic analytics, to personalization, to fraud and abuse prevention. Often no single person within an organization has a full overview of the cookies in play and their purpose.
We are looking for creative ways for developers to investigate their usage of 3rd-party cookies and learn how to fix potential breakage.
##### Target Audience
Developers who care about user privacy and want to create solutions and tooling that help devise and improve upon privacy-safe web interactions.
##### Hackathon Goals
Build a tool for developers to help them understand and mitigate usage of 3PC on their websites. This could be in Chrome DevTools, a website, an extension, or something else!
The tool should be able to receive a website URL or act on a URL that is loaded in the browser.
Important questions for developers that this tool might answer:
  * Is my site affected by 3rd party cookie deprecation?
  * Which cookies or storage are being blocked (and which website is setting these cookies)?
  * How can I fix this? What are some actionable alternatives to my usage of 3PC?


We’d love to see creative ideas for advanced visualization and allowing developers to interact with the tool to change parameters and test their changes.

42,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/enable-mastodon-apps-for-wordpress-and-its-plugins/,0,Enabling Mastodon Apps for WordPress Plugins,A proposal to enhance the 'Enable Mastodon Apps' plugin through API improvements and Block Editor optimization.,"# Enable Mastodon Apps for WordPress and its Plugins
##### Project Description
Social networks offer a straightforward user interface for common activities such as posting and commenting, while traditional CMS tend to be more intricate.
Distributed social networks present an opportunity for WordPress to regain this advantage. While ActivityPub enables decentralized communication technically, the user interface and user experience remain cumbersome.
##### Target Audience
We want to enhance the ‘Enable Mastodon Apps’ plugin and, therefore, we aim to work on either:
  1. The WordPress API, the Mastodon API, and API Authentication (OAuth).
  2. An internal API to enable other plugins to extend the Enable Mastodon Apps API using WordPress’ hook system.
  3. The Block Editor, optimizing the mapping of content published through a Mastodon App to WordPress Blocks as effectively as possible.


If this piques your interest or you are interested in the Fediverse and or Mastodon in general, welcome to the team!
##### Hackathon Goals
This project aims to make WordPress and its plugins compatible with applications initially created for Mastodon by incorporating the Mastodon API. By improving Alex Kirks’ “Enable Mastodon Apps” plugin with an internal API, other plugins will also be able to provide their functionality.
This enhancement would yield the same benefits as a traditional social network: a unified user interface for publishing, sharing, commenting, liking, and following.

43,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/securing-more-infrastructure-by-easing-os-upgrades/,0,Securing More Infrastructure by Easing OS Upgrades,"Easing the pain of OS upgrades for production environments, reducing costs and increasing infrastructure security","# Securing more infrastructure by easing OS upgrades
##### Project Description
No matter what flavor of Linux you use, upgrading production environments (especially between major versions of the OS) is one of the biggest pain points a technologist will face. While these things can be made easier with projects like , for too long devices have lingered on long-outdated operating systems due to the cost of migrating the content hosted there. 
Our goal with this project is to work together to find ways to identify the barriers to upgrades, decrease the impending doom of those barriers, and increase the security of the infrastructure we all rely on. 
Some ideas we have:
  * Work on expanding support for in-place upgrades of enterprise linux distributions through ELevate (ie – expanded repo support, adding CentOS 6 to 7 upgrades, etc).
  * Reach deeper into the user space and identify software being used that might hit snags (ie: identify what CMSs are being used).
  * Identify the most important drivers to our industries (maybe related to data consistency), and see what upgrades might need to be accommodated.


##### Target Audience
This project will benefit anyone responsible for infrastructure in which upgrading operating systems is difficult. This includes hosting providers, scientific labs, corporate entities, and much more. 
To participate in this project, enterprise Linux experience, strong documentation knowledge, hosting control panel knowledge, or deep yum knowledge would be a plus!
##### Hackathon Goals
At the end of this hackathon, we would like to have a clear list of pain points and goals for improving the lives of system administrators and DevOps engineers globally, with at least one presentable proof of concept.

# Eco-mode: Reduce outgoing network traffic of your WordPress server
##### Project Description
Recurring outgoing HTTP requests in WordPress can be a source of needless energy and bandwidth usage that can be recalibrated and optimized.
This project intends to optimize those recurring requests by hooking into wp_*_remote_get|post calls and/or the Requests library that ships with WordPress to monitor and control such requests.
A management console will be built through which the user can throttle how often recurring remote requests are happening—for example, checking a certain plugin’s updates weekly instead of daily.
There will be automatic optimization by using a hard-coded list of hooks we know we can safely throttle, as well as manual optimization by providing a UI for users to fiddle with stuff even if we don’t know about it, at the user’s responsibility. Moreover, we can identify which requests were fired during a cron process, which makes them a great candidate for automatic throttling.
Lastly, we can try to calculate/guesstimate the energy and bandwidth usage and show reports on how much you can save with certain settings.
##### Target Audience
Experience with PHP is needed, preferably but not necessarily coupled with WordPress experience.
Experience with JS is welcomed, to help with building the dashboard.
General web development experience is appreciated, around calculating and optimizing energy and bandwidth usage in applications.
##### Hackathon Goals
The goal is to create a canonical plugin (https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/canonical-plugins-revisited/) that is extensible, with smart defaults for everyday users and hides all manual controls behind an “Advanced” switch. This plugin, when enabled, will potentially save a lot of bandwidth and energy by optimizing redundant outgoing HTTP requests—without breaking anything.

# Multidomain solution for Joomla!
##### Project Description
In this project, we will develop a multidomain solution for the content management system (CMS) Joomla! This solution aims to make website management easier and more efficient by allowing users to host multiple websites on a single Joomla! installation, rather than needing to set up a separate installation for each website.
One key benefit of this approach is that it will save space on web hosts, as users will be able to host multiple websites on a single installation rather than needing to manage multiple hosting accounts. Also, the big implementation effort is highly reduced with multidomain. This can be especially useful for users who are running multiple small websites or those who are on a limited budget.
Additionally, implementing a multidomain solution is expected to improve the overall user experience when managing multiple websites, as admins will no longer need to switch between multiple installations or remember login information for multiple accounts.
Meanwhile, hosting providers can advertise this feature when they support multidomain.
##### Target Audience
Everyone who is interested in looking beyond the horizon and working with a community-driven CMS. If you have some experience with PHP, working with a framework or have experience in creating a user interface, you’re welcome to join this project.
##### Hackathon Goals
  1. Develop a functional prototype of the multidomain solution that allows users to create and manage multiple websites from a single Joomla! installation.
  2. Design and implement a user-friendly interface for the multidomain solution that makes it easy for users to navigate and use.
  3. Test and debug the multidomain solution to ensure that it is stable and reliable.
  4. Document the multidomain solution and create user guides and tutorials to help users get started with the solution.
  5. Get third-party developers on board to help them test the implementation for their extension.
  6. Work with the Joomla! community to gather feedback on the multidomain solution and incorporate that feedback into the final product.

# Improve accessibility to interactive tech events
##### Project Description
This meta-accessibility project will bring together accessibility experts, people with disabilities, and interested parties from around the world.
They will form a working group to discuss and sustainably improve accessibility issues related to interactive tech events like hackathons.
The CloudFest Hackathon organizing team has set up a communication platform on Mattermost to facilitate the exchange of ideas and discuss topics and goals for the hackathon prior to the event.
The working group will determine what they will tackle together on the ground.
They will also evaluate how remote participation in this project is possible and useful (before and during the event) to increase reach and impact.
##### Target Audience
We especially encourage web professionals and accessibility experts who themselves face disabilities to participate in this project, as well as anyone else in our industry who is interested in this important topic and committed to a more accessible and inclusive environment in technology.
##### Hackathon Goals
These will be determined by the working group. Currently we have the following ideas for goals for this project:
  * Identify accessibility issues related to interactive technical events.
  * Make suggestions for sustainable improvements
  * Develop and implement sustainable solutions
  * Create an OS website with online guidelines for future interactive technical events
  * Build a community around this project that collaborates post-event

# In-browser WordPress development environment
##### Project Description
Now that WordPress can run completely in the browser using WebAssembly via the project, it’s time to bring the entire WordPress development environment into the browser.
There are many use cases that this would open up. It could serve as the work area for the courses. Or it could be used to have unique URLs that point to replicable bug reports.
This project aims to explore browser platforms like to allow a full development workflow to happen in the browser—think `wp-env` but without requirements on your own platform, just a click away in your browser.
##### Target Audience
For the hackathon, we’d like to explore many aspects related to WordPress development:
  * Editing files from the WordPress Playground in VS Code. 
  * Contributing to WordPress core: using wordpress-develop in WordPress Playground, making modifications, and running PHPUnit tests.
  * Contributing to Gutenberg: using the GitHub version of Gutenberg, making modifications and recompiling, running JavaScript tests, and live reload for changes.
  * Contributing to WP-CLI: using WP-CLI in a terminal session, making modifications to WP-CLI commands, and running Behat changes.
  * Committing changes and creating a pull request.
  * Saving WordPress Playground state to a file, to make it easier to share interactive bug reports.


Our ideal goal is to produce a functional demo for one or two of these aspects, and to have explored potential implementations for several others. We may get stuck and deliver nothing. We shall see!
##### Hackathon Goals
Developers who feel comfortable with a non-standard and novel technology stack: WordPress, JavaScript, Web Assembly, Shell, POSIX

##### Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to standardize accessible and inclusive documentation guidelines across different WordPress teams on .The project aims to consolidate existing internal guidelines into a unified handbook. This will encourage adherence to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) principles in documentation and posts on make/WordPress sites.
##### Target Audience
We’re looking for individuals who are experienced with writing inclusive documentation, as well as those interested in developing cross-platform tools.The intention of this project is to enhance documentation accessibility, promote inclusivity, streamline compliance checks, and foster a more inclusive WordPress community.
##### Hackathon Goals
The project will explore the possibility of integrating an automated checker tool on blogs. This tool will assist contributors in adhering to the new guidelines.The checker tool could be a WordPress plugin compatible with the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg). It could also be incorporated into other tools, such as the ) or even a browser extension.
Another approach is to create content templates for common tasks a WordPress contributor might undertake. These could be provided as text snippets for use in tools like TextExpander, GitHub issue templates, or block editor patterns.
**Expected Outcomes:**
  1. Enhanced accessibility and inclusivity of documentation across all WordPress make teams.
  2. Increased awareness and understanding of DEIB principles among contributors.
  3. Streamlined process for ensuring compliance with accessibility and inclusive language guidelines.

##### Project Description
Hosting hackathons presents a dynamic and multifaceted challenge that encompasses both technological and human factors. From a technological standpoint, ensuring a seamless and productive hackathon experience involves addressing various complexities.
Fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment is pivotal for the success of a hackathon. Encouraging diverse participation and creating a culture of teamwork can be challenging yet rewarding. Organizers need to consider factors such as team formation, communication channels, and mentorship opportunities to enhance the overall experience for participants.
Addressing issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion ensures that all participants feel valued and empowered to contribute their unique perspectives and skills.
Everyone who wants to host a hackathon faces these challenges from Zero to Hero.
Cloudron, with its versatile platform, can address many of the challenges associated with hosting hackathons by providing a streamlined solution. Additionally, our initiative focuses on creating a distribution using Free and Open Source Software to offer a comprehensive toolset that caters to the diverse technological and human factors involved in hackathon organization.
##### Target Audience
Our target audience is actually everyone present at the hackathon itself.
In our project team everyone is welcome, there are so many factors to tackle that everyone can be useful.
From technical challenges to human to human interactions.
You are a first time hackathon attendee, a seasoned hackathon member, a hackathon host, a sponsor? We need everyone.
##### Hackathon Goals
With our Hackathon Project “Hack the Hackathon” we will create a template and platform for everyone to use.
Compiled knowledge from Hackathon sponsors, attendees and hosts so everyone can get started with being a host without the challenges faced by the Zero to Hero approach.

##### Project Description
In the realm of application hosting, uptime monitoring has always been the traditional approach to safeguard websites and e-commerce stores. While this is indeed efficient and straightforward, the increasing complexity of modern applications makes this method inadequate in professional settings. 
To address this flaw in modern application operation, our focus extends beyond mere uptime monitoring to encompass the true vital aspects of an online application, such as updates, user management, shop orders, and other crucial health metrics. The lack of functionality in parts of an application can often go unnoticed with standard monitoring practices.
The project aims to collect, analyze, and provide additional data from websites with a better understanding of their health to the respective operator. The website operator or hosting company is often expected to keep the overview, but the absence of a standardized format for health checks across the manifold CMS landscape makes this a hard challenge to solve.
##### Hackathon Goals
In this hackathon, we want to jointly develop a health check format that works for open-source systems like Drupal, Typo3, Joomla!, WordPress, and frameworks. The initial phase will involve the ideation and development of a standardized format for the CMS health checks, that accommodates the unique requirements of different open-source systems and offers flexibility and extensibility. Additionally, we’re aiming to have the first basic implementation for the participating CMS systems in place that can report basic health data in a secure and privacy-friendly way.
##### Target Audience
Developers, SysOps, administrators, CMS contributors, agencies and more.

52,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/managing-multilingual-content-with-wp-multisite/,0,Manages Multilingual Content with WP-Multisite,"WordPress CMS lacks built-in support for multilingual content management, but its Multisite feature could serve as an ideal basis for managing multiple languages.","# Managing Multilingual Content with WordPress Multisite
##### Project Description
The WordPress CMS does not currently provide built-in support for managing multilingual content and considers this “plugin territory”. This will change in the upcoming Phase 4 of the Gutenberg project. We believe that the APIs, functions, and capabilities referred to as “WordPress multisite” serve as an ideal basis for multilingual WordPress sites.
Multisite was introduced in 2010, in WordPress 3.0. It is an optional feature that enables the site owner to manage multiple instances of WordPress using a single installation. WordPress.com and the official White House website have been using this feature successfully for many years.
Enabling WordPress multisite capabilities by default could serve the development of Phase 4 well, and allow for maximum flexibility in developing multilingual sites in WordPress. At the same time, using multisite will allow site owners and editorial users to use all available features, including managing multilingual content, without requiring any coding knowledge.
##### Hackathon Goals
During the CloudFest Hackathon, we will plan and build a proof of concept, making it easier to use WordPress multisite. We will collect and address all relevant questions about the current, somewhat more complex integration and interface, to reduce it to the required minimum for managing multilingual websites.
Our main goal is to make it possible to use WordPress multisite as a default for serving multilingualism, not just an option. In doing so, WordPress keeps backward compatibility and can focus on the multilingual UX.
##### Target Audience
Everyone who has interacted with WordPress (or any other CMS, actually) is able to contribute. Developers, designers, testers, content editors, and pretty much everyone else. People who used WordPress multisite before may have an easier onboarding to the project, but we absolutely welcome people with a fresh and unbiased view on this topic.

53,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/can-everyone-use-_______/,0,Can Everyone Use ____? - Project Overview,"The project aims to simplify digital accessibility in web and app development by providing a central resource for developers on accessible software, apps, and websites creation.","# Can everyone use ____?
##### Project Description
Accessibility in web- and app development is overwhelming, where it really does not need to be. Currently, it feels like it’s coming at us like a tsunami. Especially with the increased legal pressure around it (ADA, EAA in June 2025, etc.) It has become a topic laced with worry, fear even. There are no shortcuts. You can’t fake accessibility. 
The good news is that digital accessibility is not really that complex, if implemented from the beginning.
Specifically for developers who depend on the use of frameworks and specific libraries, this project intends to optimize access to information about creating accessible software, apps and websites. In a way that makes sense to a developer.
There’s a lot of talk about digital accessibility, and yet it’s not easy to find one **central** resource about development frameworks and libraries with a practical approach. Information is scattered everywhere. WCAG documentation is overwhelming and dryer than the Sahara in Summer. Digging through the web is time consuming and frustrating. Besides, many sources aim to reach a broader audience, which is noble. But not always practical.
We don’t always have a choice which framework we work with. Frameworks adopt various strategies regarding accessibility. Some are designed with built-in accessibility features, while others offer minimal built-in support but compensate with comprehensive documentation for developers to implement accessibility themselves. In the worst case, certain frameworks may not offer the necessary tools for developers to enhance accessibility, or they might permit customization for accessibility but lack any guiding documentation.
##### Target Audience
To make this happen, we need both frontend and backend developers with and without experience in digital accessibility, accessibility specialists, including auditors, and people who rock researching the web for specific information, with knowledge of semantic HTML.
##### Hackathon Goals
The goal is to create a central, very practical and time saving resource for developers in a way that it actually makes sense. Think along the lines of caniuse.com. We have the domain caneveryoneuse.com (and .org) at our disposal. A place where the why, how and hacks per framework and library are neatly ordered, and new information can be added without unnecessary hurdles. We aim to start with one or two leading frameworks as the example for the rest.

54,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/json-schema-field-form-renderer/,0,JSON Schema Field/Form Renderer,"Project using JSON schema to drive dynamic admin interfaces in WordPress, leveraging react-JSON schema-form library.","# JSON Schema Field/Form Renderer
##### Project Description
There are a variety of approaches to adding forms and fields to WordPress, but they are not standardized and generally require writing a lot of boilerplate code. Generally, a lack of a “content modeling” solution makes WordPress less competitive in the broader CMS market.
This project will explore using structured JSON schema to drive the forms and fields of dynamic admin interfaces. We’ll use an existing react-JSON schema-form library to render the JSON schema as WordPress core UI components. We’ll then build a variety of examples to demonstrate the system’s functionality and flexibility.
##### Hackathon Goals
Our specific project goals include:
  * Having a lot of fun 🙂
  * Creating a reusable component that takes JSON Schema as input and outputs block editor UI form fields and validation.
  * Preparing example usages of the renderer, including a WordPress admin page, custom block editor interfaces, blocks that produce forms on the front end, plugin settings pages, etc.
  * Collecting feedback on the approach’s viability from key WordPress and Gutenberg contributors.
  * Stretch goal: Exploring the variety of options for how form data can be stored (e.g. options, serialized block data, post meta, custom database tables)
  * Stretch goal: Explore integrating a full-featured JSON schema editor into WordPress using Monaco Editor Framework or similar.


##### Target Audience
Our target audience is developers and UX designers who would love to see a forms and fields API in WordPress.

55,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/public-sector-website-funding-transparency/,0,Public Sector Website Funding Transparency Project,"Project aiming to track technology choices on public sector websites in Germany, analyzing costs, security, and innovation implications.","# Public Sector Website Funding Transparency
##### Project Description
Our tax money funds countless website launches and updates across the public sector. But what technology powers these sites – open-source solutions or proprietary software? Where are they hosted? Are there regional differences between states or trends we can track in municipalities? Understanding these choices influences not only costs but also potential security and innovation implications.Let’s build a tool to take regular snapshots of approximately 2,000 public sector domains in Germany. We’ll analyze them and track patterns over time, revealing how technology decisions evolve within the public sector. If this works well, we could create a similar tool for our European partners to use with their local domains – imagine the insights a cross-country comparison could reveal!
##### Hackathon Goals
  * Start with a pilot set of several hundred domains.
  * Analyze results to validate the approach and refine the tool.
  * Create a public portal to showcase findings and promote transparency.


##### Target Audience
Concept Architects, Programmers, Designers, SysOps, Data Scientists

56,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/integrating-mariadb-catalogs-with-php-platforms/,0,MariaDB Catalogs with PHP Integration,Migrate MariaDB Catalog feature into PHP platforms & frameworks for better resource utilization and user management.,"# Integrating MariaDB Catalogs with PHP Platforms
##### Project Description
At CloudFest 2023, the MariaDB Foundation had discussions with many hosting providers about how we could help make MariaDB better for them. The end result of those discussions is a new feature called “Catalogs”. This feature allows for an isolated collection of users and databases. Effectively containerisation inside of MariaDB Server.
The Catalogs feature allows hosting providers to control siloed accounts for their customers, whilst keeping the more memory-hungry parts of MariaDB Server into one single process, saving expensive resources.
But for the Catalogs feature to reach its full potential, we need integrations into the popular frameworks and CMSs, as well administrative interfaces in those applications for people to be able to use it.
For this hackathon, we therefore propose to explore the following areas:
  * Build a generic PHP library that provides a PHP interface for programmatic control of the Catalogs feature, like a CRUD interface, status querying, etc…
  * Build integrations into popular PHP CMSs or frameworks, like WordPress (as a WP-CLI command and. or a multisite driver), Drupal, Joomla!, Laravel, etc…


##### Target Audience
Database enthusiasts, PHP developers, security experts and everyone interested in getting their favorite PHP framework/CMS to support a cutting-edge database feature.
##### Hackathon Goals
At the end of the hackathon, we aim to have a usable PHP package that can be pulled in via Composer and allows a PHP application to communicate with the MariaDB Catalogs feature, as well as one or more direct integrations of that package into CMSs or frameworks, like WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, Laravel, …

57,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/accessible-infographics/,0,Accessible Infographics Project,Proposal for a standard in inclusive visual communication through accessible infographics.,"# **Accessible Infographics – a new standard for inclusivity in visual communication**
##### Project Description
Accessible infographics can be the difference between someone understanding essential information or getting the digital door smacked in their face.
TLDR; Many sites, but particularly webshops rely heavily on infographics to present vital information that helps buyers make confident and informed decisions. These visuals simplify complex details like product features and benefits, pricing breakdowns, and usage instructions.
For example, webshops may use infographics to highlight dimensions, weight, materials, or performance metrics such as battery life or durability. Apparel stores often include sizing charts and international size conversions, while furniture retailers showcase dimensions to help customers visualize fitting products into their spaces.
Infographics also communicate critical health and safety information, such as allergy warnings, safety precautions for children or pets, or maintenance tips for long-term use. Webshops offering sustainable products use infographics to display eco-certifications, carbon footprint reductions, and ethical production standards. Other uses include detailed shipping and delivery timelines, return policies with step-by-step instructions, and visual comparisons between products or competitors. However, many of these infographics remain inaccessible to people with disabilities, excluding a significant audience.
At this hackathon, we’re creating a WordPress plugin that provides accessible infographics. Think screen-reader-friendly charts, tactile graphics support, and interactive elements that work seamlessly for all users.
An accessible infographic plugin for WordPress can transform these visuals into universally accessible tools, empowering webshops to deliver this essential information inclusively. This not only improves the shopping experience but also increases trust, engagement, and conversions for WooCommerce businesses.
For the backend development, you don’t need to be an accessibility expert, but for the frontend knowledge of creating accessible user interfaces (following WCAG guidelines) is important. More information further down.
Together, we can set a new standard for inclusivity in visual communication! essential.
##### Target Audience

58,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/securing-the-supply-chain-for-oss/,0,Securing the Supply Chain for OSS: Challenges and Solutions,The project addresses software supply chain security concerns for open-source ecosystems due to regulatory requirements and security threats.,"# Securing the Supply Chain for OSS
##### Project Description
Software supply chain security has become a critical concern for open source ecosystems, particularly in light of new regulatory requirements and increasing security threats. The EU Cyber Resilience Act, which enters into force in December 2024, mandates that manufacturers, software developers, importers, distributors, and resellers ensure their products with digital components remain secure throughout their lifecycle. This is just one example of the growing regulatory landscape that open source projects must navigate.
Current challenges include ensuring continuous access to security updates, maintaining separate security and feature update channels, implementing vulnerability disclosure programs, and providing transparency through Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA). Many open source projects, especially in the CMS ecosystem, lack the tools and workflows to meet these requirements effectively.
This project aims to develop solutions that address these challenges through modular, reusable components. Using WordPress plugin development as our initial implementation use case, we’ll create tools and workflows that can benefit the broader open source community. The goal is to enable projects of all sizes to implement robust supply chain security measures without reinventing the wheel.
##### Target Audience
  * Open source software vendors and maintainers
  * CMS platform developers and contributors
  * Security professionals and researchers
  * Organizations deploying CMS solutions at scale


##### Hackathon Goals
The project scope is flexible and will be refined based on team composition and expertise. Potential deliverables may include:
  * Security update channel implementations
  * Cryptographic code signing solutions
  * SBOM generation and verification tools
  * Vulnerability disclosure program tooling
  * Documentation and implementation guides
  * Cross-CMS security standards


Teams can focus on one or more of these areas, or propose additional solutions that address supply chain security challenges in open source ecosystems.

59,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/wp-cli-mcp-host/,0,WP-CLI as an MCP Host: Bridging WP Development and AI,This project integrates Model Context Protocol (MCP) with WP-CLI to enable developers to use AI capabilities during local WordPress development without requiring a live site or REST API endpoints.,"# WP-CLI as an MCP HostEnabling AI-Powered WordPress Development
##### Project Description
WordPress development workflows currently lack seamless integration with AI capabilities, particularly during local development. While REST API endpoints enable AI interactions with live sites, developers working with local WordPress installations have limited options for AI-assisted content creation and site management. This project aims to bridge this gap by implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the WordPress ecosystem, specifically integrating it with WP-CLI.
The core innovation is transforming WordPress into an MCP Server and WP-CLI into an MCP Host through a new package, enabling direct AI interactions with WordPress installations during development. This approach provides developers with powerful AI capabilities without requiring a live site or REST API endpoints.
**WordPress MCP Server Layer:**
  * Implementation of MCP Server interfaces in WordPress
  * Resource providers for posts, pages, media, and other WordPress content types
  * Tool definitions for common WordPress actions (content creation, media handling)
  * Context providers for WordPress configuration and site state


**WP-CLI MCP Host Package:**
  * MCP Host implementation within WP-CLI framework
  * New command namespace for AI operations
  * Integration with (local and remote) LLM providers
  * Transport layer for local WordPress communication


##### Target Audience
  * WordPress developers working with local environments
  * DevOps teams managing multiple WordPress installations
  * Content creators using WP-CLI in their workflow
  * Plugin and theme developers requiring testing data


##### Hackathon Goals
  1. Core Implementation 
     * Functional WP-CLI MCP Host package
     * Basic WordPress MCP Server implementation
     * Example commands for content generation
  2. Developer Experience 
     * Documentation and setup guides
     * Debug tooling integration
     * Example workflows and use cases
  3. Demo Scenarios 
     * Content generation with context awareness
     * Media handling and featured image generation
     * Bulk operations with AI assistance

##### Project Description
The CMS Health Project is focused on establishing a standardized approach for content management systems and related services to communicate their health status. This initiative facilitates seamless integration with monitoring tools, load balancers, and other infrastructure components, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of system health across various platforms.
Traditional uptime monitoring is insufficient for managing modern, complex digital infrastructures. Basic availability checks indicate whether a site is reachable, but they do not provide insights into crucial aspects such as software updates, user management, order processing, and other key health metrics. Without detailed monitoring, service disruptions may go unnoticed, leading to potential operational and business risks.
To address these challenges, the CMS Health Project aims to define a standardized health check format applicable across multiple open-source CMS platforms, including Drupal, TYPO3, Joomla!, and WordPress. This common format allows website operators, hosting providers, and developers to obtain comprehensive health data, enabling them to maintain and optimize their services more effectively. By advancing this initiative, the CMS Health Project contributes to a more robust and transparent approach to monitoring and maintaining CMS platforms. Establishing a widely accepted standard for health checks will facilitate better infrastructure management and service availability across the open-source ecosystem.
During the previous hackathon, substantial progress was made with the creation of an , and reference implementations, e.g. for and . Additionally, a repository with was developed, along with an initial version of a designed to interpret and display health data. A was also launched, providing centralized access to repositories and relevant project information.
##### Target Audience
  * **Developers** : Those working on CMS core functionality, extensions, and integrations.
  * **System Administrators** : Responsible for maintaining and optimizing CMS-based infrastructures.
  * **Hosting Providers** : Seeking to improve monitoring capabilities and service reliability.
  * **CMS Contributors** : Open-source developers and maintainers focused on improving platform health.
  * **Agencies** : Managing multiple websites and requiring standardized monitoring solutions.
  * **Security Professionals** : Interested in privacy-friendly and secure health monitoring practices.


##### Hackathon Goals
Building upon these achievements, this year’s hackathon will focus on several key areas:
  * **Review and Refinement of the RFC** : Assessing industry developments and adjusting the standard accordingly.
  * **Repository Evaluation** : Analyzing the state of existing repositories to identify areas for improvement and further development.
  * **Monitoring Tool Enhancements** : Improving data visualization, security, and integration with various CMS platforms.
  * **Expanding Reference Implementations** : Developing health check integrations for additional CMS platforms beyond TYPO3 and WordPress.
  * **Community Outreach and Adoption** : Increasing awareness and collaboration within the open-source community to drive the adoption of standardized health monitoring practices.
  * **Collaboration Strengthening** : Encouraging cross-CMS cooperation to ensure a unified and effective monitoring solution. The status of the repositories will be analyzed to identify optimizations and further developments, particularly in enhancing the monitoring tool, expanding reference implementations to additional CMS platforms, and increasing outreach efforts within the open-source community. Strengthening collaboration among CMS developers and contributors remains a fundamental goal, ensuring a standardized approach to health monitoring that fosters reliability and transparency across various platforms.

61,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/cms-freedom/,0,Project CMS Freedom Overview,CMS Freedom tackles platform transition obstacles by building theme adapters and data type adapters for smoother site transfers.,"# CMS Freedom
##### Project Description
This project aims to tackle two obstacles in the way of freely transferring sites from one CMS or platform to another: namely that different systems maintain non-compatible representations for a site’s theme and custom data types.
For example, consider three popular platforms:
  * Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language and can read data in Markdown front matter or in external resources like a CSV.
  * TYPO3 uses its own Fluid templates with TypoScript configuration and can read custom elements through one of many data processors.
  * WordPress relies on its own block-based templating system and reads data from variants of its post type as well as meta key/value pairs for the post


Because these systems are unique, direct conversion is not possible, they require adapters. This project will build these missing theme adapters and data type adapters, enabling smoother transitions between platforms.
LLMs will power the extraction and generation of compatible visual representations, as well as a mapping from each custom content type into those representations. An intermediate format for layout and templating will unify efforts to add new adapters, as they will only need to provide the import from or the export to that intermediate format.
##### Target Audience
  * **Developers & Agencies**: Who frequently migrate websites between CMS platforms and need automated solutions.
  * **Hosting Providers** : Seeking to offer easy site transfers for their customers.
  * **CMS Contributors** : Looking to improve interoperability between platforms.
  * **Open-Source Enthusiasts** : Interested in contributing to a tool that promotes data freedom and portability.


##### Hackathon Goals
  * Develop **theme adapters** to translate layouts between different templating engines (e.g., Liquid → Fluid → Block Templates).
  * Build **data type adapters** to map structured content (e.g., custom fields, taxonomies) across CMS platforms.
  * Implement an **intermediate format** for layout and content mapping, ensuring long-term adaptability.
  * Leverage **AI** to automate the generation of compatible visual and structural representations.
  * Create a functional prototype for at least one end-to-end migration path (e.g., Jekyll → WordPress).


By the end of the hackathon, we aim to have a proof-of-concept demonstrating automated site migration across at least two CMS platforms, laying the foundation for a fully-fledged open-source solution.

62,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/aiccessiblity-content-updater/,0,Acessiblity Content Updater Project Description,"WordPress plugin to enhance website accessibility via auto-generated skip links, improved alt text and ARIA attributes.","# AIccessiblity Content Updater
##### Project Description
A WordPress plugin will enhance website accessibility. It will automatically add skip-to-content links, improve alt text for images using AI, and add ARIA attributes to buttons. The plugin will operate behind the scenes, processing HTML during page rendering. The initial focus is on basic WordPress sites; WooCommerce support is a future consideration. The plugin’s functionality will rely on an existing AI service via API.
##### Target Audience
The plugin targets WordPress website owners. A subscription to an AI service will be required for the Proof Of Concept. 
Skills needed:
  * Prompt engineering
  * DOM manipulation (language agnostic)
  * Caching system development (language agnostic)
  * WordPress hook implementation (PHP)
  * Accessibility testing (screen reader experience helpful)
  * Image analysis & detection (screenshot engine)


AI expertise is not required; an existing AI service will be used via API. Open-source LLMs are not considered for this hackathon due to time constraints and the complexity of image analysis.
##### Hackathon Goals
Develop a proof-of-concept plugin demonstrating improved website accessibility. Three key features will be implemented: skip-to-content, improved alt text, and ARIA attributes. Pre- and post-implementation metrics will be tracked to assess effectiveness.

63,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/federated-community-events/,0,Federated Community Events,Project aims to create a comprehensive solution combining federated event technologies with improved user experience for local community organizers.,"# Federated Community Events
##### Project Description
Local community organizers are increasingly looking for alternatives to centralized event platforms like Meetup.com due to rising costs and platform limitations. While some communities have moved to standalone WordPress solutions with events plugins, they miss out on the network effects and discovery features that make centralized platforms valuable.
This project aims to create a comprehensive, ready-to-use solution that combines existing federated event technologies with an improved user experience. Building upon the existing WordPress ActivityPub event bridge, we’ll create a “Community Event Starter Kit” that makes it easy for community organizers to host and share their events in the Fediverse while maintaining full control over their platform.
Key features will focus on discoverability and community engagement, including “events near you” functionality, cross-community discovery, and seamless federation through ActivityPub. By leveraging and enhancing existing open-source solutions, we’ll create a practical alternative to commercial event platforms that prioritizes community needs and interoperability.
##### Target Audience
  * Community organizers and meetup hosts
  * Local tech communities and user groups
  * Event platforms seeking federation capabilities
  * WordPress site operators


##### Hackathon Goals
The project scope is flexible and will be refined based on team composition and expertise. Potential deliverables may include:
  * Streamlined installation and setup process for existing federation tools
  * Enhanced event discovery features
  * Implementation of geographic-based event recommendations
  * User interface improvements for event management
  * Documentation and migration guides
  * Community engagement features


Teams can focus on improving specific components of existing solutions or develop new features that enhance the platform’s usability.

64,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/wordpress-staging-environment-manager/,0,WordPress Staging Environment Manager Overview,"A multi-platform tool to simplify WordPress staging environment setup, ensure security, and prevent data corruption or broken integrations.","# WordPress Staging Environment Manager
##### Project Description
The **WordPress Staging Environment Manager** is a multi-platform tool (plugin + CLI) designed to address the widespread issue of improperly configured staging environments, particularly for WordPress and WooCommerce users.
This tool simplifies staging environment setup, ensures data security, and prevents issues like production data corruption or broken integrations. Automating configuration and providing clear visual guidance within WordPress Admin enables developers and merchants to establish reliable, secure, and effective staging environments.
Hosting Providers can take advantage of the included CLI tooling which would allow them to integrate those automation into their tooling and offer complete staging environments to their clients. 
The tool will offer checks and features such as:
  * Validating staging environment configurations (e.g., WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE, disabling live emails).
  * Automated selective content sync from production to staging with anonymized user data.
  * Visual alerts and prompts to guide users.
  * Long-term expandability to support plugins and integrations beyond WooCommerce through hooks while setting up a staging environment. 


This tool is critical for merchants using Omnisend and other integrations where proper staging is essential.
##### Target Audience
  * **WordPress Merchants** : Those using WooCommerce and Omnisend frequently face issues with improperly configured staging environments.
  * **Developers** : Professionals who want automated solutions to simplify staging setup and avoid manual errors.
  * **Hosting Providers** : Companies seeking tools to streamline staging for their WordPress-hosted customers.


##### Hackathon Goals
During the hackathon, the team will focus on delivering an **MVP** of the Staging Environment Manager with the following:
Deliver basic user guides and examples for both the plugin and CLI tool.
  1. **Core Plugin Functionality** : 
     * Validate staging configurations automatically.
     * Provide actionable alerts and recommendations within the WordPress Admin interface.
  2. **CLI Tool** : 
     * Enable advanced users to automate staging setup and validation via command-line commands.
  3. **WooCommerce Compatibility** : 
     * Prioritize key staging checks for merchants using WooCommerce, such as safeguarding order data and anonymizing user/customer information.
  4. **Data Migration:**
     * Possibility to migrate data from Live to staging environment while keeping the data light and remove PII to prevent data breaches through less secured environments.
  5. **Documentation** : 
     * Deliver basic user guides and examples for both the plugin and CLI tool.

65,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/peer-to-peer-federated-rag-framework/,0,Peer-to-Peer Federated RAG Framework Project Overview,"Proposes a decentralized system for information retrieval and generation, operating hierarchically with node expertise and confidence-based responses, improving scalability and federated knowledge graph capabilities.","# Peer-to-Peer Federated RAG Framework
##### Project Description
In today’s data-driven world, efficiently accessing and generating information across diverse domains is crucial. Our project proposes the development of a Federated Peer-to-Peer Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Network, a decentralized system where each node specializes in a specific domain. This architecture allows content hosts to join existing groups or establish new ones, creating a collaborative environment that enhances information retrieval and generation.
The network operates hierarchically, forwarding queries to the most relevant nodes based on their expertise. Responses are aggregated with a focus on confidence levels, ensuring reliable and accurate information delivery. This approach not only scales efficiently as more nodes participate but also fosters a federated knowledge graph capable of handling similarity queries, thereby improving the depth and relevance of generated content.
By leveraging this federated, peer-to-peer model, our project aims to revolutionize how information is retrieved and generated across various domains, promoting collaboration and specialization within a scalable and efficient network.
##### Target Audience
  * **Developers** : Expertise in peer-to-peer networking, distributed systems, and RAG models.
  * **Data Scientists** : Experience in knowledge graph construction and query optimization.
  * **Domain Experts** : Specialists in various fields to contribute to node specialization.
  * I**nfrastructure Support** : Resources for hosting nodes and managing network operations.


##### Hackathon Goals
  * Design and implement a peer-to-peer network architecture: Develop a decentralized framework that allows nodes to join, leave, and communicate efficiently within the network.
  * Develop hierarchical query routing mechanisms: Create algorithms to forward queries to the most relevant specialized nodes or groups based on their domain expertise.
  * Implement confidence-based result aggregation: Establish methods to aggregate responses from various nodes, prioritizing results with higher confidence scores to ensure reliability.
  * Create a federated knowledge graph: Integrate data from participating nodes to form a comprehensive knowledge graph that supports similarity queries and enhances information retrieval.
  * Ensure interoperability and scalability: Design the system to support various data formats and scale efficiently as more nodes and data are added.

66,https://hackathon.cloudfest.com/project/cms-cloud-manager/,0,CMS Cloud Manager Overview,"Project aims to simplify CMS deployment management by providing automated configuration, backup features, and environment control without requiring advanced technical knowledge.","# CMS Cloud Manager
##### Project Description
Our project aims to simplify how users manage their CMS deployment and the platform they host them on. The idea is to make it possible for non-technical users to safely run their own server(s) without requiring advanced knowledge of common management tools like Terraform / OpenTofu and Ansible.
The manager should automatically configure the server with sane defaults that provide the user with peace of mind. Additionally, we could automatically provide features such as automated backups, instance creation, and configuration of S3-compatible object storage, all while maintaining a provider-agnostic approach. The key focus is enabling the user to easily manage the server and the environment, thereby reducing the need for experience with additional management tools.
We aim to build a CMS and hosting agnostic solution, with an initial proof of concept (PoC) using WordPress on Hetzner.
  * Implement a secure solution for handling API keys used to control server infrastructure. This will be necessary to prevent malicious actors from gaining full control over the server and the CMS
  * Demonstrate the feasibility of integrating hyperscaler APIs (e.g., S3 storage, backups, scaling, and staging environments) into the daily management tasks of operating a CMS 
    * Reuse backup functionality and store provided by the hosting provider
    * Ability to automatically configure object storage
    * Ability to mutate the underlying infrastructure


##### Target Audience
If you’re passionate about streamlining CMS management, simplifying cloud hosting, and enhancing security, this project is for you! Join us to make a tangible impact on how users interact with their CMS and hosting platforms. Your expertise will be invaluable as we shape the future of CMS hosting.
This solution is aimed at developers, system administrators, and companies who are seeking a lightweight, flexible tool for managing hosting environments. It’s particularly beneficial for those familiar with CMS systems who want a simpler and streamlined approach to management tasks that would otherwise require more complex and heavyweight tools.
##### Hackathon Goals
At the end of the hackathon, we have two primary goals. Firstly, we aim to have a functional prototype that empowers users with an easy yet secure way to manage their servers, the environment, and the CMS. Secondly, we’re dedicated to finding a robust and innovative solution for securely storing and utilizing API keys within the context of our prototype, ensuring that user data and server infrastructure remain protected.
